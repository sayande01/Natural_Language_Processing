    "### N-grams in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "**N-grams** are continuous sequences of `n` words from a given text, where `n` determines the length of each word sequence. They’re often used in Natural Language Processing to capture context and sequence information that single-word representations (like Bag of Words) miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Capture patterns in text by grouping words together, allowing models to understand relationships and word sequences.\n",
    "- **Types**:\n",
    "  - **Unigrams**: Single words (e.g., `\"I\"`, `\"love\"`, `\"learning\"`)\n",
    "  - **Bigrams**: Pairs of two consecutive words (e.g., `\"I love\"`, `\"love learning\"`)\n",
    "  - **Trigrams**: Triplets of three consecutive words (e.g., `\"I love learning\"`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using N-grams helps models understand word context better, such as distinguishing `\"New York\"` as a location rather than two unrelated words.\n"
